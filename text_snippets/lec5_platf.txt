Platform:
- Importance: most top brands & startups have platform ecosystems as core or support
- business based on enabling value-creating interactions between external producers and consumers
- Key Roles (exchanging data & feedback):
	- Producer (of platforms offerings)
	- Provider & Owner (of Platform)
	- Consumer
	
Digital Platform:
- markets where user interactions are subject to network effects facilitated by a common platform
- platform provides open, participative infrastructure
- sets governance conditions
- combine and deploy (digital) technologies to coordinate an ecosystem of supply and demand
- extensible IT artifact that provides core functionality (access via interfaces)

Platform ownership:
- factor of design & governance of digital platform ecosystems, defines relationships
- Distribution of power:
	- Single Owner: single, central owner controls platform ecosystem
	→ facebook, iOS, SAP cloud (act quickly)
	- Consortium: group of actors own digital platform
	→ cloud foundry
	- Peer-to-Peer community: community (users) governs dig. platform
	→ blockchain

Multi/ Two-sided Markets
- enable interactions between endusers
- includes two independent groups of customers
- e.g. Credit cards: Consumer credit (Market 1), Issuing Bank (Intermediary), Merchant processing (Merchant processing)
- e.g. Recruiting Applicants ← Linked in → Employers

Characteristics Multi-sided BM:
- Network Effects:
	- Direct/Same-side (increase in usage → increased welfare of same side e.g. telephone)
	- Indirect/Cross-side (increased usage of one product → increase value of complementary product e.g. app store)
- Launch Strategies: each side depends on prior existence of the other side(indirect)
	- Follow-the-rabbit: build on existing success of non-platform “shops” (e.g. amazon’s own book sales)
	- Piggyback: connect with existing user base from other platform (e.g. PayPal piggybacked on eBay)
	- Seeding: create value units relevant to set of potential users (e.g. google awarded android app developers)
- Competition Within Platform Ecosystems
	- User level
	- Platform level (btw complementor and platform, e.g. Amazon Marketplace)
- Competition Between Platform Ecosystems
	- Platform level: interoperability vs exclusivity (iOS vs Android),
	- with strong network effects winner-take-all or winner-take-some markets
	- User level: Single- vs Multihoming (use Netflix & Disney+)
- Winner-take-all:
	- supply-side economies of scale
	- strong network effects
	- high multihoming
	- lack of niche
	- platform offer same services!
	- e.g. Whatsapp
	
Value Co-Creation
- Without platform: Value creation linear & determined
- With platform: Value co-creation process continuous follows virtuous cycle (bcNWEffects)
	- value is created in the connection between user and ecosystem

Platform value-creating mechanisms
- efficient & convenient facilitation of transactions
	- help complementors and consumers locate, interact and exchange value
	- acts as an intermediary by directly matching supply to demand
- provision of affordances making the digital platform a breeding ground for innovation
	- platform owners offer development tools for complementors
	- use boundary-resources to co-create value-adding complements
- Supermodularity:
	- increased amount of product A makes product B more valuable
	- A and B are different products (e.g. sell apps → value phone increases)
	- about network effects
- Generativity:
	- capacity to produce unprompted changes driven by varied audiences
	- ecosystem builds itself analoguous to real ecosystem
- Economies of scale and substitution:
	- Reusing modular components
	- thus, easier to implement new transactions and innovations
- Affordances:
	- digital infrastructure build upon a modular software-based platform
	- reconfigure platform to adapt user needs and prompt new technological advances
	- allow developers/ users to do sth
	
Platform Governance App Store: 3 dimensions
- Decision rights partitioning: provide autonomy
	- platform owner can transfer decision rights
	- Platform decision rights: whether owner & app developers make decisions pertaining to platform
	- App decision rights
	- 2 classes decision rights: Strategic & Implementation
- Control portfolio design: ensure integration (control development process of third- parties)
	- gatekeeping: who and what apps are allowed
	- process control: incentives to follow prescribed development methods
	- metrics: incentives based on predefined performance metrics
	- relational control (informal): norms & values of a platform
- Pricing Policy: Create Incentives to invest in own app
	- 4 questions: symmetric or asymmetric, pricing for access or usage, pie-splitting using fixed or sliding scale, app pricing
	- Asymmetric: subsidize one side, make up losses by increased profit from another
	- revenue sharing & subsidizing
	
Boundary Resources (BR) in Platform Governance
- Def.: resources that support developers in their effort; BR define interaction with platform; BR implement platform governance
	- Application: Technical resources (e.g. support with Hardware)
	- Development: Support dev. process (e.g. SDKs)
	- Social: Control interactions and behavior (e.g. automatic feedback app store)
	
Digital Platform Ecosystems
	- platform owner: implements governance mechanisms
	- to facilitate value-creating mechanisms
	- on digital platform
	- autonomous complementors and consumers
	
Ecosystem analogy
	- reservoir of finite resources
	- populations controlled by impulses (developer and user communities: variations)
	- interactions between participating units (shared market)
	- adaption of individuals and the system
	- need for balance/adaption (higher diversity support a more stable equilibrium; ecosystem foster other areas when one market segment is obsolete)
	- dynamics: top-down (one dominant firm), bottom-up (open source)
	
Ecosystem Integration
	- Tight Coupling: mutual dependent elements, responsiveness (to changes)
	without distinctiveness (extent of differ)
	- Loose coupling: independent elements, distinctive responsiveness, flexible
	scalability
	- Decoupling: Distinctiveness without responsiveness
	
Complementor autonomy
	- degree of freedom for complementors in value co-creation
	- High: loosely-coupled (contribute to variety & amount)
	- Low: tightly-coupled (strengthen core value proposition)
