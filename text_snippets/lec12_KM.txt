Knowledge Sharing and Distribution
- get knowledge to the right places
- task: make knowledge accessible for people who need it
- challenge: transfer knowledge (individuals → groups)
- problems: no access (codification) to existing knowledge
- approaches
	- room for exchange
	- WIKIs (edit any page, simple mark-up language, used collaboratively)
	- Enterprise Social Networks (communication, collaboration, networking)
	e.g. slack
	→ overcome obstacles (digital objects difficult to find & access, identify
	people who can help, make invisible communication visible)
	- (Reverse-) Mentoring
Barriers of Effective Knowledge Transfer
- Short in time
- Low information about knowledge demand of others
-Missing awareness of the importance of knowledge transfer
- Attitude: “Knowledge is power” and “Shared knowledge weakens own position”
- Missing transparency about knowledge bearers and knowledge sources
- High specialization of employees
- Little organized possibilities for knowledge transfer
- Corporate culture
- Missing or inadequate incentive systems
- Hierarchical structures
- Inadequate information infrastructure
- Financial structure
Supporting Concept: Organizational Metaknowledge
“Organizational metaknowledge refers to knowledge about who knows
what and who knows whom within the organization.“
• Enterprise social networks can make invisible communication visible.
• Visible communication improves metaknowledge with two mechanisms
	– message transparency: Seeing coworkers’
	messages helps to infer about others’ knowledge.
	– network translucence: Seeing the structure of coworkers’ communication
	networks helps to infer about who coworkers talk with somewhat regularly.

Knowledge usage
- make sure knowledge is actually used
- task: ensure productive use of organizational knowledge
- challenge: knowledge identification is not enough
- problems: barriers inhibit use of external knowledge
examples:
- knowledge communities
	- informal group of people with shared interest to specific subject
	- communities support (app): membership, work-flows, tools (chat, repository), analyze member data and profiles
- lessons learned
	- systematic documentation and processing of experiences to learn from them
	- pro: preserves knowledge, avoids extra or duplicate work, reduces training time of new employees
	- contra: documenting effort, requires willingness of employees to share and use knowledge, plan in time (management)
	- exp: Xerox
- best practice sharing
	- document best possible solution (efficiency, effectiveness) to a given
	problem
	- replace existing processes
	- pro: increase efficiency and effectiveness, solutions are proven in
	practice
	- contra: lack of generalizability (too specific to an organization), too
	strong focus may be limiting
- storytelling
	- create and distribute stories (learning histories)
	- common: how will organizations deal with obstacles?; How will boss react to mistakes?
	- pro: sets knowledge into a context, well-suited for complex issues,
	perfect for human beings, more flexible than lessons learned or best
	practices
	- contra: highly time-consuming, high personnel effort to create stories,
	no short-term benefits
	
Knowledge Conservation
- guard myself against knowledge losses
- task: select important knowledge, ensure adequate storage, regular updates
- challenge: existing knowledge should be useable in the future
- problems: knowledge loss through re-organization or movement of labor
Negative Reinforcement Cycle of Knowledge Losses
- Knowledge updates are not done
- Quality of contents worsens
- Trust in contents decreases
- Usage of knowledge base decreases
examples:
- knowledge repositories = depositories for explicit knowledge in which knowledge units (KU) are registered,
 administered and made accessible
- ontology: concepts set into relation (vehicle-water-air)

Knowledge Assessment
- do KM investments pay off
- measure effort in KM: select suitable indicators
- reveal success and failure in KM
- without measure KM would NOT be efficient → cycle incomplete
- examples:
	- balanced scorecard
	- benchmarking: systematic comparison products, services or processes
	to identify strengths and weaknesses, forms (internal, competitive, functional,
	generic)
	Examples
	- KM Performance Framework (de Gooijer, 2000): BSC + behavioural sci.
	- Process-oriented Performance Measurement (PPM)
