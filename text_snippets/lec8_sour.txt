“The reason that we want someone else to do work for us is that they are experts”

Outsourcing
- = outside + resource + using
- execution of certain in-house tasks are completely transferred …
	- … to one/several external companies
	- … for certain period of time
	- … based on conceptual agreements
- IT context: single or whole IT-tasks are given to another company
- make or buy ?

Client Perspective - Reasons
- Cost: transparency (pay per use); cost reduction
- Personnel: avoid lack of qualified IT-employees; more independent from single employees
- Risks: transfer risk to outsourcing vendor; shift of risks from complexity in application and technology dynamics
- Concentration: IT focus on business value and strategic information systems
- Finances: from fixed to variable costs (increased liquidity); avoid high investments
- Knowledge: access specialized knowledge & novel technology; more discipline in knowledge conservation (documentation)

Risk Client
- Cost: switching cost; increased coordination & communication cost; no cost reduction as expected; lack of transparency; impossible to control vendors’ prices
- Personnel: loss of key employees & knowledge; motivation loss of remaining IT-employees; legal issues
- Knowledge: know-how transfer; competitive advantage; increasing outsourcing results in loss of IT-competence and know-how
- Technology: fixed commitment to vendor’s technology (vendor lock-in); danger of too much standardization
- Privacy: maintain privacy of confidential data dependent on vendor
- Return to own IT: might not be possible (long-term commitment of contracts); rebuild know-how and whole IT department

Vendor Perspective
- higher quality services can be provided at lower cost (maintain expertise in technologies)

Chronology
• Backsourcing
	– Bring previously outsourced jobs back to be performed internally
• Insourcing
	– Assign a project/ found a fully owned	subsidiary within a company rather	hiring a third party
• Outsourcing
	– Individual internal tasks are handed over to one or more other companies for a defined period of time on the basis of a contractual agreement

Sourcing Object
- ca. 1960-80: IT Infrastructure Outsourcing (ITO) → Hardware/Software
- ca. 1980-90: Application Service Providing (ASP) → Applications
- since 1990: Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) → Business functionality
- in the beginning more maturity and experience, later more complexity
- core competencies to retain in own company:
	- development of strategy & architecture
	- establishment of standards
	- capability to evaluate outsourcing options
	- repository of all installed applications and hardware
	- consultancy on cost/benefit, strengths/weaknesses, risks/potential of IT
	- evaluate architecture fit of new hardware/software
	- monitor old systems (+ retirement, replacement)
→ exp: deutsche bank & IBM (management Teil komplett bei Deutsche Bank)

Vendor Configuration
- different Customer-Vendor-Relationship (e.g. Number of vendors, which services, part-inhouse)

Pricing
- Fixed-Price
	- service priced with a flat charge (lump sum)
	- Pro: easy to budget and control costs
	- Contra: only feasible if costs are easy to forecast; higher costs; risk for conflicts (contract); additional services charged separately
	- e.g. 2.000.000€ for running call center
- Cost-based
	- service provider bills cost (Time & Material) + profit margin
	- Pro: beneficial if demand varies and if service delivery costs are difficult to forecast
	- Contra: high controlling costs to ensure cost-efficient work; important to know service provider costs
	- e.g. service cost + 5% profit margin / + 1.000.000€ profit
- Transaction-based
	- service fee per transaction or unit
	- Pro: flexibility regarding demand variance; possibility for volume discounts; cost transparency and accountability (user, SBU)
	- Contra: demand forecast to manage costs; potentially infinite resource availability
	- e.g. 5€ per call to call center
- Performance-based
	- pricing based on pre-agreed business outcome (fixed+variable)
	- Pro: encourages collaboration and creative problem-solving; affords vendor greater freedom in achieving the predefined results
	- Contra: hard to determine performance (external factors); hard to find service vendors for high objectives; high downside risk of over-ambitious solutions (risk-sharing)
	- e.g. 5.000.000€ + 30% of costs saving to status quo
	
Location
	- Headquarter
	- Onsite: on own company premises
	- Onshore: same country
	- Nearshore: same continent
	- Offshore: other country or continent

Client Perspective - Stage Model
Phase 1: decision process
- intelligence - why: determinants, advantages, disadvantages
- design - what: outsourcing alternatives (degree ownership, degree outsourcing)
- choice - which: guidelines, procedures and stakeholders of decision initiation, evaluating and making
Phase 2: implementation
- implementation
	- how: vendor selection, relationship building and management
	- outcome: experiences/ learning, types and determinants of success
	
Vendor Perspective - Process Model
Discovery
- development market opportunities 
- receive and analyze RFI
- conduct initial feasibility study
- develop business strategy
Definition
- form formal project team
- define scope of work
- study customer's situation and systems
- do benchmarking
- write and submit RFP 
Confirmation
- sign Memorandum of Understanding
- define negotiation strategy
- prepare performance measures
- do negotiation
- develop contract sheet
- make a contract
Transition
- develop transition plan
- define transition objects
- decide transition method and schedule
- transfer the selected assets
- set up working environment for outsourcing
Execution and Management 
- execute outsourcing service
- measure performance and customer satisfaction
- propose alternatives for improvement
- improve processes

Cloud Computing
- IT deployment model
- based on virtualization
- resources (infrastructure, applications, data) deployed via internet as distributed service
- one/several service providers
- services scalable on demand & priced on pay-per-use

Types
- Private Cloud within Organization A
- Public Cloud includes Organizations A,B and C
- Hybrid Cloud within Organization A combined with Public Cloud (A,B,C)
- Community Cloud with Organization A,B and C within a Community
→ Cloud Computing can lead to complex outsourcing relationships

Offshoring - Outsourcing
Offsh. Definition 
- getting work done in a different country/continent
Outsour. Definition 
- contracting work out to an external organization
Offshor. Risks 
- transfer jobs to other countries
- geopolitical
- language differences
Offshor. Benefits
+ availability of skilled people (global talent pool)
+ getting work done faster
+ specialized skills
Outsour. Risks
- poor communication
- misaligned interests ofclients and vendors
- reliance on third parties
- lack of in-house knowledge (critical business operations)
Outsour. Benefits 
+ lower costs
+ cost efficiencies
+ labor flexibility

Offshoring Drivers
- External:
	- lower trade barriers
	- global offering of services
	- significant labor cost advantages in offshore regions
	- real-time global collaboration (communication technologies; internet)
- Internal:
	- shorter product life cycles (time-to-market)
	- limited IT budgets (cost reduction)
	- higher IT-service standards
	- increasing experience in IT outsourcing
	
Risks of Offshoring: Client Extra Costs
- cost savings through offshore outsourcing = 
	domestic client costs without/ prior to offshore outsourcing
	- contract-based payment to vendor
	- client extra cost for managing contract/vendor
	
Client Extra Cost Categories
- Specification:
	- explain & define what services are required
	- identify constraints on system operations and development
- Design:
	- describe software structure (data, interfaces, algorithms, …) to be implemented
- Knowledge transfer:
	- communicate knowledge from client to vendor organization
	- vendors apply knowledge
- Coordination:
	- integrate and link together client and vendor resources
	- accomplish collective set of tasks
- Control:
	- ensure vendors’ actions
	- should be consistent with achieving client's desired objectives
