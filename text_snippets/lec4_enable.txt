Strategic Information Systems (SIS):
- assure competitive advantage for company (avoid drop)
- System Categories
1. Inter-Organizational Systems
	- connect two partners in value chain (e.g. flixbus)
	- differentiate by system developer & operator
2. Value-Added Services
	- support offering state (order initiation/ processing) & improve
	customer service/relation (after-sale, additional services to
	product)
3. IT for new products and services
	- develop new products & business areas (e.g. IPhone)
	- evolutionary (instead of revolutionary)
4. Electronic markets
	- enable and merge transactions via digital platforms
	- revolutionary (e.g. amazon, netflix)

- Porters Competitive Forces help with decision making
- dimensions: operations, strategy
Factory (operations high, strategy low)
- Goal: Improve performance of core processes

Support (operations low, strategy low)
- Goal: Improve local performance 

Adaptability Gap in Digital Business
- Traditional Business vs Digital Business
- environment stable dynamic
- level of competition low high
- certainty certain uncertain
- Knowledge utilization creation & innovation
- Business processes simple & static dynamic & IT-based
- Ways of doing business limited multiple
- stakeholders pressure moderate severe
- Adaptability Gap between Business Strategy & Business Processes no yes

Business Model:
→ fill gap between Business strategy (highly aggregated) and Business
process model (operational, detailed) with a business model (= conceptual
tool of alignment, tactical)
- Druckers Question: Who is customer, what does he value, and how does an
organization intend to earn money?
- Example representation: Business Model Canvas (Key Partners, Key
activities, Key Resources, Value Proposition, Customer Relationship,
Channels, Customer Segments, Cost Structure, Revenue Streams)

Magic Triangle:
- 4 elements of business model ( ~ Drucker)
- business model is blueprint of how a company creates and captures value
- WHO are our target customers? → customer
- WHAT do we offer to customers? → value proposition
- HOW is the value proposition created? → value chain
- WHY does it generate profit? → profit mechnism

A business model innovation …
… creates new logic regarding how a company creates/captures value
… makes changes in >= 2 of the WHAT, WHO, HOW, and WHY

Types of IT-Associated Business Models (steininger)
- facilitator: Sale of traditional goods or services
- mediator: Mediation and physical delivery, sale of traditional goods or services
- outcome: Sale of hardware or software
- ubiquity: Completely digitized product or service, digitally sold and delivered

Innovation:
- new goods/methods/markets/sources of supply/organization of industry
- idea perceived as new
- transforms materials into products or services of greater value

Types of Innovation
- Core Concepts, Linkage between Core Concepts and Components
- Reinforced
	- unchanged: incremental innovation
		- refines and extends an established design
		- improvement in individual components
		- underlying core design concepts, and links between them, remain the same
	- changed: architectural innovation
		- reconfiguration of an established system
		- changes only the relationships between existing core design concepts
		- link existing components in a new way
- Overturned
	- unchanged: Modular Innovation
		- changes only the core design concepts
		- without changing the product’s architecture
	- changed: Radical Innovation
		- establishes a new dominant design
	- new core components that are linked in a new architecture
Disruptive Innovation:
- pushing established technology/ business models out of the market
- not radical innovation
- Christensens Criteria → it is not possible to forecast market disruption ex-ante (only indicators)
	- Historically most valued attributes (underperforms in old dimensions)
	- Other qualities (superior in dimensions not valued before)
	- Cost and margin (cheaper)
	- Simplicity (more convenient)
	- Interest of main customers (little interest of current leader’s customers)
	- first customers (situated in niche or emerging markets)
	- first vendors (high rate of start-ups or companies new to market among innovative companies)
	- Value chain (different structure)
	- Market distribution (displace dominant in mainstream market)
