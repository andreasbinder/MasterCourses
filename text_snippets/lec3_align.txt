Market-Based View (MBV) - Porter’s Five Forces
- new market entries (barriers to entry)
- supplier (bargaining power)
- customer (bargaining power)
- substitute products/ services
- competition within market
Implications
- companies search for attractive markets and position yourself within
competition: choose generic strategy, influence direct market surroundings
- Starting point: objectives that should be reached
- “Structure follows strategy”: companies’ organizational structure should
follow the targets
- emphasize the role of external factors (attractiveness of industry, competitive
forces) for business success

Cost Leadership: striving to be the low-cost producer in an industry
- effective if …
	- … market is composed of many price-sensitive buyers
	- … there are few ways to achieve product differentiation
	- … buyers do not care much about differences (brands)
	- … there is a large number of buyers with high bargaining power
- idea: drive competitors out of the market
- gain market share and sales
- underprice competitors
- offer better cost-value ratio (similar price, but better value)
Differentiation: produce products that are considered unique
- allows a firm to …
	- … charge higher prices for its products
	- … gain customer loyalty
- risk: unique product may not be valued highly enough by customers to justify the higher price
Focus on Niche: producing products and services that fulfill the needs of small groups of customers
- effective if …
	- … the niche is profitable and growing
	- … industry leaders are uninterested in niche
	- … industry offers several niches
	- … there is little competition in the niche segment
- low-cost focus strategy
	- offers products/services a small range (niche) of customers at the
	lowest price available
- best-value focus strategy
	- “-” at the best price-value available
	- called “focused differentiation”
	
Resource-Based View (RBV)
- 2nd alternative theory for competitive advantage
- Success & failure depends on companies’ internal capabilities
- core competencies & resources responsible for success/competition (starting point for strategy development)
- recommendations for core competency management
	- determine existence of core competencies and analyze their potential
	- keep tangible resources up to date
	- develop intangible resources/capabilities
- VRIN
	- V = Valuable: enable firm to implement strategies (increase efficiency
	and effectiveness)
	- R = Rare: not available to other competitors
	- I = Imperfectly imitable: hard to implement by others
	- N = Non-substitutable: can not be replaced by some other non-rare
	resource
- components: Resources Competencies Product
- Dynamic Capabilities: relate to change in organization, 3 primary clusters of
competencies
	- Sensing: Identification/Assessment of opportunity
	- Seizing: Mobilization of resources
	- Transforming: Continued renewal
	→ source for long term competitive advantage (renewal of components
	following vision)
- Components of RBV:
	- Vision
	- Dynamic Capabilities: Sense innovation, Adapt resources &
	competencies in changing environment → Knowledge (how transform
	e.g. electric)
	- Competencies: use resources efficiently → Knowledge (e.g. how use
	IT)
	- Resources: VRIN (e.g. assets, capital, structure) → Knowledge,
	Information (asset) (e.g. customer data & manager process knowledge)
- Components (Resources, Competencies, Product) 

Strategic Fit / Business IT Alignment
- Porter: Strategic fit among many activities is fundamental not only to competitive
advantage but also to the sustainability of that advantage. It is harder for a rival to
match an array of interlocked activities than it is merely to imitate a particular
sales-force approach, match a process technology, or replicate a set of product
features.
- Reich: Strategic alignment is the extent to which the business mission, objectives, and
plans are supported by the IS mission, objectives, and plans
- Henderson: Alignment is the degree of fit and integration among business strategy, IT
strategy, business infrastructure, and IT infrastructure.

Strategic Alignment Model
- external
	- business strategy: Business Scope, Distinctive Competencies, Business Governance
	- IT strategy: Technology Scope, Systemic Competencies, I/T Governance
- internal	
	- Organizational Infrastructure and Processes: Administrative Infrastructure, Processes, Skills
	- I/S Infrastructure and Processes: Architectures, Processes, Skills
	
IT Alignment in Multi-Business Organizations
- Corporate Strategy: capabilities to compete as an organisation
- Corporate IT Platform Strategy: shared IT capabilities across the organisation
- Strategic Business Unit strategy: capabilities to compete in individual markets
- Strategic Business Unit IT Portfolio Strategy: IT portfolio capabilities within each Strategic Business Unit
- Functional Alignment (R1): (between Corporate Strategy and Corporate IT Platform Strategy)
	- Corporate strategy provides boundaries for IT platform strategy
	- Corporate IT Platform needs to align with strategy
- Functional Alignment (R2): (between Strategic Business Unit strategy and Strategic Business Unit IT Portfolio Strategy)
	- SBU IT portfolio needs to support business strategy
	- SBU strategy provides requirements for SBU IT portfolio
- Structural Alignment (R3): (between Corporate IT Platform Strategy and Strategic Business Unit IT Portfolio Strategy)
	- Corporate iT Platform leverages synergies shared across IT services
	- Independence btw SBU IT Portfolios (if relevant for more than one SBU
	move to IT Strategy)
- Structural Alignments (R4): (between Corporate Strategy and Strategic Business Unit strategy)
	- Corporate strategy provides boundaries for strategies of SBU
	- SBU strategy has high degrees of freedom within corporate strategy
	boundaries
- R5: between Corporate IT Platform Strategy and Strategic Business Unit strategy
	- SBU strategies do not define corporate platform strategy
	- IT capabilities should not meet individual SBU strategy requirement →
	Possible Misalignment
- R6: Corporate Strategy and Strategic Business Unit IT Portfolio Strategy
	- Corporate strategy does not specify IT capabilities for SBU IT portfolios
	- SBU IT portfolios should NOT include IT capabilities to be shared
	across SBUs → Possible Misalignment
Two paths to temporal alignment in Multi-Business Organizations
• Path 1 (P1): sequence of strategic choices to develop the shared IT platform capabilities.
between Corporate Strategy and Corporate IT Platform Strategy
• Path 2 (P2): sequence of strategic choices to develop SBU IT application capabilities.
(typical top-down, business-led approach for alignment)
between Corporate Strategy and Strategic Business Unit strategy and Strategic Business Unit IT Portfolio Strategy
