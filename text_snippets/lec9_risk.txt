Security
- absence of unbearable risks

Risk
- RE (risk exposure) = probability(adverse future event) * magnitude(event)
- RRL (risk reduction leverage) = (REbefore - REafter) / cost of intervention
- probability that particular adverse event occurs during stated period of time
- event results from a particular challenge

Information Security
- information that companies collect , store, manage and transfer as organizational asset
- adds value to business
- needs to be protected
- often held electronically
- transmitted using electronic means
→ Growing dependence on information systems, shared networks and distributed services (cloud computing)
→ organizations more vulnerable to security threats

Definition Information Security is the practice of defending information from ...
- … unauthorized access
- … use
- … disclosure
- … disruption
- … modification
- … inspection
- … recording
- … destruction
→ general term used regardless of the form the data may take

Basic services
- confidentiality: information not available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, processes
	- encryption of stored and transmitted data
	- access control
	- notification in case of data breach
- data integrity: data has not been altered or destroyed in unauthorized manner
	- hash-functions
	- back-ups
	- access control (email signatures, transmission certificates)
	- validating inputs
- authentication: verify identity
	- user’s access credentials (password, fingerprint, chip cards)
	- certificates
- availability: reliable access at the right time on information and IS
	- data/server replication
	- redundancy
	- load balancing
	- SLAs with external/internal providers
	
Higher services
- accountability: trace activities on a system to individuals who may then be held responsible for their actions
	- auditing & logging
	- cross-department collaboration
	- cybersecurity awareness training (legal standards)
- data authenticity: data being genuine and able to be verified and trusted; confidence in validity of data itself and its authorship
	- certificates for the website
	- keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC)
- non repudiation: way of guaranteeing that message sender cannot deny having sent a message
	- message authentication codes
	- digital signatures
	- auditing & logging (time-stamp, verify registrations)
- access control: granting authorized entities to use information, while preventing access to non-authorized entities
	- definition of roles, attributes or rule
	
Understand privacy and discuss key changes of the GDPR
Privacy
- “contextual integrity”
- sharing information outside of socially agreed contextual boundaries
- decision privacy
	- about person’s decisions and choices
	- private actions
	- protect persons decisions from external interferences
- information privacy
	- ability of a person to control, edit, manage and delete information about themselves
	- decide how and to what extent information is communicated to others
	
Impacts and Issues
As data can be stored and processed in the “Exabyte” level and more connectivity and interaction is possible, information is ubiquitous.

Threats
- Internet
	- use of cookies to store online behavior
	- cloud computing: access data and usage statistics (vendor), ambiguities regarding legal issues
- Big Data
	- profile users, identify patterns and predict interests & behavior
	- eventually result in future discrimination and inequalities
- Social Media
	- steering users’ behavior of sharing (like-button)
	- “fake” news vs. user generated content
	- privacy features only as build-in ‘add-ons’ rather than by design
	- exchange personal data for the benefits of using services
- Internet of things
	- automatic adaption of environment to user
	- usage of explicit preferences and implizit observations
	- user autonomy as central theme in considering privacy implications

EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- applied EU-wide since May 25 2018 in national data protection laws
- aim: giving control over personal data
key changes
- increased territorial scope
- penalties
- consent
- breach notification
- right to access
- right to be forgotten
- data portability
- privacy by design
- data protection officers

Risk categorization
- known risks:
	- can be uncovered
	- carefully evaluate project plan, business and technical environment of project
	- inspect other reliable sources
- predictable risks:
	- extrapolated from past project experiences (past turnover)
- unpredictable risks:
	- can and do occur
	- extremely difficult to identify in advance (zero-day attack)
	
Risk Strategies
- Reactive: “don’t worry, I’ll think of something”
	- nothing is done about risks until something goes wrong (fire fighting)
	- crisis management
	- often used
- Proactive:
	- avoid risk
	- contingency plan to handle unavoidable risks in a controlled manner
→ find balance between risk occuring and the maximum bearable damage
→ pareto principle: optimize situation without worsen any other component
→ diminishing marginal benefits: the higher the level of security every additional effort only increases security a little bit more

Risk Identification
- transfers uncertainties in a set of clearly defined risks
- tools: expert interviews, brainstorming, analogies, risk registers
Risk Analysis
- assesses identified risks regarding their …
- ... probability of occurrence
- ... (negative) impact on the project/organization
- tools: expert interviews, cause-and-effect analysis, decision trees, threat tree
Risk Handling
- evaluates, plans, and executes strategies for the analyzed risk
- tools: risk strategy list, decision tables/trees, cause-and-effect analysis
exp: risk strategy list
Nelson Best Practices
avoid …
	- … poor estimating, scheduling & planning
	- … ineffective stakeholder management
	- … insufficient risk management
	- … insufficient planing
	- … shortchanging quality assurance
	- … weak personnel and/or team issues
	- … insufficient project sponsorship
Risk Monitoring
- tracks risk evolution over time
- tools: status reports, to-be analysis, risk visualizations

Characteristics
1. Project Size
- measurable in workers/years of effort
- interpersonal communication (exponential growth with team size)
2. Company-relative technology
- degree of technical experience
- education/familiarization costs for new things (tools, concepts, hardware, software, communication, …)
- expect unexpected (unplanned) interface problems
3. degree of inherent structure
- well-defined project outputs ?!
- do developers understand what is requested (implement)?
- have they already built a system like this before?
