Current Role of IT
- software stack continues to be commoditized, yet specialized software
remains strategic
- best business software is invisible → still needs to be managed

Challenges of evaluating IT value
- IT/IS creates value: different types (financial: ROI, intermediate:
process-related, affective: perception-related)
- IT/IS creates value under certain conditions (need to fit in strategy, clear
alignment): part of business value creation process with other organizational
factors (synergistic = mitwirkend)
- IT/IS value manifests in many ways : different ways (productivity, profitability),
different levels e.g individual (satisfaction), firm, industry
- IT/IS based value != IS based competitive advantage: differential value →
advantage
- IT/IS based value could be latent (time lag)
- Numerous factors mediate IT/IS & value
- IT resources → Mediating factors: IT and Organizational
Complementary Resources, Organizational Capabilities, IT-Strategy
Alignment → IT Intermediate value -> Output value (perceived by
customers) / Financial value
→ IT/IS value is elusive: difficult to fully capture and attribute value generated by
IT/IS investments

IT/IS Potentials
- automate: reduction of manual actions
- informate-up: providing information to top management
- informate-down: providing information to employees across firm
- sequential: natural order of activities or even parallel processes
- precise/ targeted: continuous process monitoring
- analytical: complex analysis of existing information
- integrative: pooling of heterogeneous activities
- knowledge creation: creation of knowledge and expertise
- simplifying: removing of intermediaries and business process redesign
- geographical: overcoming space
- transform: redefining the business model, business processes and relationships of firm

Contextual Factors influencing Business Value of IT
- IT Business Value Generation Process: IT Resources (technology, human), complementary organizational resources, business processes, business process performance
- focal firm: organizational performance
- competitive environment: switching costs, industry characteristics, needs and demands, revenue attractiveness, trading partner resources & business processes
- macro environment: global market conditions, capital markets, country characteristics, mega trends

Consequences of IT/IS Value Ambiguity
- cannot articulate value → tend to focus on cost
- cost of IT appears: substantial, never-ending, not well managed
- Creates IT direction toward: under-investment, down-sizing, outsourcing
→ problem: cut of IT

Path of communicating IT/IS value (CIO)
1. change thinking; avoid value traps
2. show that IT/IS provides value for money
3. show how IT/IS improves business performance
4. show how value is created beyond and behind IT/IS
→ changing mindset to long-term picture for success

Digital Business Strategy
- IT Strategy and Business Strategy not divided anymore
- adapt business infrastructure to digital value
- organizational strategy formulated and executed by leveraging digital
resources to create differential value.
- Going beyond the traditional view/ beyond systems and technologies,
- elevating the performance implications of IT strategy beyond efficiency and
productivity metrics to those that drive competitive advantage and strategic
differentiation
Key External Digital Trends: pervasive connectivity, information abundance, global supply chains, improved price/performance, growth of cloud computing, emergence of big data
key organizational shifts: limitations of traditional business models, trans-functional role of it, new mandate for it and the CIO, increased familiarity with it
-> scope of digital business strategy, scale of dbs, speed of decision making, sources of value creation and capture
-> performance

Performance Measures of IT/IS Business Value
- Productivity: Production efficiency, Economic Growth
- Market performance: total shareholder return, stock market reaction
- Accounting Performance: Cost ratios, turnover ratios, profit ratios
- Intangible Benefits: Increased capabilites, knowledge, better decision
making, competitive advantage

Level of Measurement of IT/IS Business Value
- measure effects of IT investments on different levels but other factors might
change
- Process Level: Efficiency
- Firm level: Stock
- Micro/Project level
- Industry/competitive level: compare
- Macro-economic/country level
- customer surplus

IT/IS Business Value- Distinction
- Measuring business value of IS: assessing business value post-investment: Is
system resulting in performance gain? Can gain be measured? How?
- Evaluating IS investments: assessing feasibility of new investments
pre-investment: Should invest in new system/IT? Cost? Expected gain?

Business Value Process
- exploration: understand customer needs
- planning: define requirements, propose solution, estimate ROI, assess merit, prioritize projects
- development: decide on funding, create metric plan, establish baseline
- deployment: roll out solution, measurement, analyze ROI from actual data, customer satisfaction

Approaches to assess IT/ IS Value and Benefit
- analytic portfolio appraisal, strategic appraisal, economic ratio appraisal, other analytics appraisal, integrated appraisal, economic discounting appraisal

Example method: Simple Multi Attribute Rating Technique (SMART)
•A systematic process for decision making
•Based on an
–identification of the different alternatives and
–their relevant attributes ,
–assignment of weights for each attribute and
–calculation the weighted arithmetic mean for each alternative.
•Sensitivity analysis
1. Identification of decision maker
2. Identification of alternatives
3. Identification of relevant criteria and their effects
4. Measure the value of benefit for every alternative and for every
criteria
5. Assign weights for every criteria
6.Calculate the weighted arithmetic mean using all criteria for every
alternative
7. Make a provisional decision
8. Sensitivity analysis
