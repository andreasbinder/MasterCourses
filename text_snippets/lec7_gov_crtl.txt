Relationship IT Governance & IT Controlling:
- IT Governance : ensures final objectives are met
- IT Controlling: ensures critical success factors are met
- Design variables (e.g. Processes, IT) 
	→ Success factors (e.g. customer service, time to market) 
	→ Objectives (e.g. shareholder value) 
	← Competition, Economy, Regulations

Controlling:
- management concept for future oriented corporate and profit controlling
- strategy for safeguarding corporate existence
- provides essential decision support

IT-Controlling:
- control IT of an organization
- formal objectives (efficiency, effectiveness) (macro)
- content objectives (quality, functionality, schedule adherence) (micro)
- also coordination function

IT Controlling functions / IT process model:
- Project portfolio controlling: Make selection of fitting IS project transparent
	- it strategy development
	- development of IT strategy and master plan
	- definition of hardware, software and security standards
	- planning of IT portfolios and priorities
- Project controlling: execute projects correctly (plan, manage, monitor costs, schedules, services)
	- it development
	- development and maintenance of individual software
	- implementation of standard application software
- Product and infrastructure controlling: Monitoring of product use through product life cycle (handle operation)
	- it operations
	- compilation and operation of IT infrastructure (networks, central server) 
	- service and user support
	- supply of desktop services
	
1. Strategic:
Project portfolio controlling:
- Life-cycle:
	- it strategy development
	- it project proposals
	- it portfolio analysis
	- it portfolio adjustment
	- it portfolio communication
	- it portfolio controlling
- Selection Criteria:
	- Benefits: Financial/Non-Financial (e.g IT advantages)
	- Simplicity of Implementation: Project Risk / Project Complexit
Project Controlling & Product, infrastructure controlling:
- Balanced Scorecard:
	- Performance measurement framework, translates organizations strategy to set of performance measures
Balanced IT Scorecard
	- CSF: Critical Success Factor, vital for strategy, not measurable
	- KPI: Key Performance Indicator, measurable
	- Goal CSF KPI Targets Initiatives

2. Operative:
Project Controlling:
- IT project controlling:
	- Cost: estimation (function point analysis or COCOMO), reporting
	- Time: milestones, Gantt Chart
	- Quality: quality gates, customer reviews
Project Controlling & Product, infrastructure controlling:
- Metrics System:
	- Metric = quantitative judgement on planned or actual value of a criteria of a steering object
	- types: steering, information, benchmarks, quantitative/qualitative
	- Domain with Top metric gives objectives for subdomain, subdomain gives measurement of metrics for topdomain (KPI to calculate other KPI)
	- e.g. Economic Value Added
	
Corporate Governance:
- corporate virtues (for shareholders): limiting liability of investment, buy & sell ownership interests easily
- Potential misalignment of interests between shareholders and managers → separation of ownership and Control
- system which directs and controls business corporations
- structure specifies distribution of rights and responsibilities among different participants (board, manager, stakeholders)
- define rules and procedures for decision making on corporate affairs
- provides structure to set company’s objectives and monitor performance

Corporate Governance & IT Governance

IT Governance
- represents framework for decision rights & accountabilities
- encourage desirable behavior in the use of IT
- systematically determine who makes decision (decision right), who has input to a decision (input right), and how these people are accountable for their role
Design of IT Governance
- Business Goals: 
	- Build current and future shareholder/stakeholder value 
	- at An acceptable level of risk 
	- by Engaging and aligning business leadership
- IT Governance Goals
	- Establish / Enforce Accountability for IT Operational Performance
	- Establish / Enforce Accountability for IT Projects
	- Align IT Investment to Business Strategy and Objectives
	- Manage IT Related Risks
	- Involve Key Business Stakeholders
	- Build Decision Making Transparency
- IT Governance Core Components
	- Structure, Accountability, Authorities
	- Targets and Feedback
	- Compliance and Reinforcement
	- Process, Participation, and Timing
→ Good IT governance draws on corporate governance principles to manage and use IT to achieve corporate performance goals

COBIT:
- Control Objective for Information and related technology
- Framework for governance & management of enterprise information & technology
- Defines 7 Components to build & sustain governance system
- which decisions, how, by whom?
- defines design factors
- governance & management objectives
→ No silver bullet, need to tailor

COBIT Principles 2019
1. Provide Stakeholder Value:
	- governance needed to satisfy stakeholder needs, to generate value
	- value is balance among benefits, risk and resources
	- need actionable strategy governance system to realize value
	- Steps
		- stakeholder drivers and needs
		- enterprise goals
		- alignment goals
		- governance and management objectives
2. Holistic Approach:
	- governance system for enterprise IT is built from number of components that can be of different types and work together
	- components
		- processes 
		- organizational structures
		- principles, policies, procedures
		- information
		- culture, ethics and behavior
		- people, skills, competencies
		- service, infrastructure, application
3. Dynamic Governance System:
	- when design factors changed, need to consider impact on enterprise governance
	- dynamic for future-proof system
4. Governance distinct from management:
	- able to clearly distinguish between governance and management activities
	- Governance: stakeholder needs, balances & agreed-on enterprise objectives; direction set through prioritization and decision making;
	monitor performance and compliance against agreed-on direction
		→ responsibility of board of directors
		→ Evaluate, Direct and Monitor (EDM)
	- Management: plans, builds, runs, and monitors activities; in alignment with direction set by governance body; achieve enterprise objectives
		→ responsibility of executive management (CEO)
		→ Align, Plan and Organize (APO); Build, Acquire and Implement (BAI); Deliver, Service and Support (DSS); Monitor, Evaluate and Assess (MEA)
5. Tailored to Enterprise Needs:
	- tailor by using set of design factors
	- Governance system design workflow
	1. Enterprise context and strategy
	2. determine initial scope of governance system
	3. Refine scope of governance system
	4. conclude governance system design
6. End-to-End Governance System:
	- governance should cover enterprise end-to end
	- focus on all I&T processing to achieve goal
	- emphasis on enterprise-wide view of I&T governance
		- impossible to separate business & IT (integral part of enterprise governance, cover full end-to-end business and IT functional 		areas)
