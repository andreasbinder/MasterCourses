“In an economy where the only certainty is uncertainty, the one sure source of lasting competitive advantage is knowledge!”

Knowledge economy
- organizational performance dependent on the production, diffusion, and use of knowledge.
Knowledge-based firm theory
- knowledge is the major source of competitive advantage of a firm

Wisdom
• is an evaluated / deep understanding
➢identify best approach to solve a problem

Knowledge
• is understanding of rules to interpret information
➢rules & understanding of relationships; answers "how" questions

Knowledge
- mix of framed experience, values, contextual information, and expert insight
- provides framework for evaluating and incorporating new experiences and information
- originates and is applied in the mind of knowers
- understanding of rules needed to interpret information
- appropriate collection of information, such that its intent is to be useful
- characteristics:
	- using knowledge does NOT consume it
	- transferring knowledge does NOT result in losing it
	- knowledge is abundant, but ability to use it is scarce
- embedded in documents, repositories, routines, processes and norms

Objectives
- Knowledge Management
	- identify, capture, evaluate, retrieve and share all of an enterprise’sinformation asset
- Knowledge Sharing
	- individual provides knowledge to others
	- social process, not only a question of management

Alignment of Knowledge and Strategy
- keep knowledge gap minimal

What to manage in KM
- 70% People: attitudes, sharing, innovation, team work, motivation, organization, communities
- 20% Process: KM maps, workflows, integration, best practices, business intelligence, standards
- 10% Technology: data stores, networks, internet, data mining & analysis, decision tools, automation
→ Learning

Business Process as area of Application
- Input: knowledge domain as resource
- output: knowledge as product / service

Strategies for KM: 
- Communication (between groups) & Codification

Four Types of Knowledge Conversion
- Socialisation (experienced knowledge) tacit -> tacit: people are exchanging knowledge
- Externalization (conceptual knowledge) tacit -> explicit: people sit down and create wiki entry based on their personal tacit knowledge
- Internalisation (operational knowledge) explicit -> tacit: people are reading externalized wiki entry and apply that knowledge, making that knowledge tacit and richer through adding their experience resultung from the application of the explicit knowledge
- Combination (systemic knowledge) explicit -> explicit: people combine multiple wikie entries to a condensed one

Tacit knowledge (~ 90%: Eisberg unter Wasser)
- knowledge extremely difficult to make explicit (implied)
- subjective, cognitive
- highly personalized
- difficult to formalize
- sticky knowledge
Explicit knowledge (~ 10%: Spitze vom Eisberg)
- set out in tangible form (physical)
- e.g. policies, goals, strategies, papers, reports
- codified/leaky knowledge

Spiral of Organizational Knowledge Creation
- multiply knowledge by transferring to others through externalization & internalization via combination & sozialization
- info might get lost

Core Processes of Knowledge Management
Knowledge Objectives
- what kind of knowledge important today as well as in the future with a knowledge-based competitive advantage
- where in the organization is what kind of knowledge needed
- strategic planning of organizational knowledge base
- Goals:
	- normative: knowledge oriented corporate culture
	- strategic: retain / establish knowledge (organizational structure, management system)
	- operative: execution of strategic knowledge goals, define operational goals for day-to-day business
	
Knowledge Identification
- how to create transparency about existing knowledge
- task: analysis and description of knowledge environment
- challenge: overview of internal and external data, information, and capabilities
- problems: inefficiency, uninformed decisions, duplication
- approaches
	- knowledge bearer maps (research methods, publications, technical, teaching)
	- knowledge balance sheets
	- process modelling
	
Knowledge Acquisition
- what capabilities to acquire from external sources
- task: what knowledge to acquire through recruiting or acquisition (consultants)
- challenge: ensure best possible access to external knowledge
- problems: unused potential for KA in existing cooperations
- approaches
	- hiring
	- consulting
	- outsourcing, mergers, acquisitions
	
Knowledge Development
- build up new knowledge
- task: build new knowledge additional to external acquisition
- challenge: develop new capabilities, better ideas, powerful processes
- problems: knowledge creation very difficult in areas without expertise (R&D)
- approaches
	- learning environment (create freedom, reduce workload, …)
	- room for experiments
	- workshops
- example: MOOC (online courses); data warehouse, process mining
